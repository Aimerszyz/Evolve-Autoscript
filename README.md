# Evolve-Autoscript
My personal userscript for the game Evolve by Demagorddon - https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/

# Stuff to do

## Bugfix
* Fix research settings, because I don't think it works correctly (also doesn't take into account new crispr for both religions)

## Small
* Update autoCraft to use multiplier buttons, as large storage values cause clicks to crash/not trigger
* Add click rate setting for Auto Farm
* Add granularity to Auto Print (only Auto Priority right now, idk what else I could split it into)
* Add install instructions to README
* Add Mercenary button to action queue
* Add Assemble Gene button to action queue
* Maybe add sacrifical alter? Never played new mantis yet

## Large
* Update Auto Support. Currently simplistic allocation, and support buildings not implemented
* Auto Fortress
* Auto Mass Ejector
* Refactor priority system to use single priority queue
* Update Auto Tax to take into account money limits
* Update Auto Battle for more optimal battles
