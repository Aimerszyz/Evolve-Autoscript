# Evolve-Autoscript
My personal userscript for the game Evolve by Demagorddon - https://pmotschmann.github.io/Evolve/

# Stuff to do
* Change backend stuff to use document methods rather than JQuery since it's a little slower. Can also revert the inheritance properties of HTML elements to actually use inheritance
* Add Moon cycle checking to only assign craftsmen when needed (Would increase overall production rate as craftsmen are mostly useless)
* Add rate priority to control building power
* Add estimation for craftsmen intake/output
